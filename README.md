## Virtual Meeting Room

Every user would be able to create a virtual avatar. The virtual room would show every other user in the room, and users would be able to speak to one another like a normal room using positional audio. Integration with controllers or peripherals like the Leap Motion could be used to animate the avatars.

## Portal

Bring the gameplay concept of Portal to VR. Special puzzles will have to be created to minimize walking, and focus instead on moving with portals.

## Space Exploration

An active experience travelling through space. Planets, stars, and other bodies can be pseudorandomly procedurally generated. The user would be affected by gravity from interplanetary bodies. Similar to No Man's Sky, but better and without the gameplay of being on planets.
